Professor Pat is a fast paced puzzle game that throws back to the flash games of early Newgrounds and Kongregate designed for both desktop and mobile. You're tasked to determine what the pattern of people are before time runs out for your level. As you progress, things mess with the game area that make it more difficult to determine, well, the pattern. There's a clear ending to the game, allowing pursuit of high scores by solving the patterns faster. 

There's no compliation required! Professor Pat uses the [CreateJS](https://createjs.com/) library to do HTML5 canvas animations and rendering. It's entirely written with normal ES5 javascript. localStorage is used to keep track of high scores locally. The art and soundtrack are both made by me r3as well. The art and music project files are included in the repo as well but aren't required for running the program.
